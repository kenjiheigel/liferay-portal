# PR Check

Run premerge checks against the current branch. The skill iterates through the validations listed below, runs each one whose scope covers a changed path, and reports PASS or FAIL. Integration tests, Playwright tests, and Poshi tests are out of scope. Use the `test-plan` skill when their coverage is needed.

## Repository Settings

Use the column for the repository that a remote of this checkout points at (check `git remote --verbose`).

| Setting | `liferay/liferay-portal` | `liferay/liferay-portal-ee` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Base Branch** | `master` | `master-private` |
| **Scopes** | branch, portal, workspaces | branch, workspaces |
| **Skipped Validations** | Workspace Source Format | Source Format |
| **Rules Commit** | `HEAD` | `master` |

`liferay-portal` skips Workspace Source Format because Source Format already formats every changed file, workspace files included. `liferay-portal-ee` skips Source Format because the repository has no `portal-impl` to run the formatter from, and Workspace Source Format formats each workspace instead.

In `liferay-portal-ee`, this skill and its validations are copied from local `master`, so local `master` is the rules commit there.

`${BASE_BRANCH}` below stands for the **Base Branch** setting, and `${SOURCE_SHA}` stands for the **Rules Commit** setting, which is the commit this document and its validations were read from.

## Preconditions

- **On a feature branch.** When `HEAD` is `${BASE_BRANCH}` or detached, exit with a one line message.

- **Working tree clean.** `git status --porcelain` must return empty. When dirty, abort and ask the developer to commit first.

- **Rebased on the latest `${BASE_BRANCH}`.** Resolve the remote. Prefer `upstream`, otherwise the remote whose URL points at the repository named by the column in use (check `git remote --verbose`). When none resolves, compare `git merge-base HEAD ${BASE_BRANCH}` to `git rev-parse ${BASE_BRANCH}`. Abort and tell the developer to rebase when the two differ, and warn that the branch was not checked against a remote. Otherwise run these steps.

	1. `git fetch <remote> ${BASE_BRANCH}`.

	1. Fast forward local `${BASE_BRANCH}` to the fetched tip. When `${BASE_BRANCH}` is checked out in another worktree, fast forward it there with `git -C <worktree> merge --ff-only <remote>/${BASE_BRANCH}`. Otherwise update it in place with `git fetch <remote> ${BASE_BRANCH}:${BASE_BRANCH}`, which also creates `${BASE_BRANCH}` when it does not exist. Both are fast forward only. When the command fails for any reason, such as a diverged `${BASE_BRANCH}`, a worktree that is not clean, or a denied permission, warn the developer and stop the run. Never continue against a stale base, since every validation would then compare the branch with a base that lacks the latest commits.

	1. `git rebase <remote>/${BASE_BRANCH}`. On a clean rebase, continue against the rebased branch. On conflict, list the unmerged files (`git diff --diff-filter=U --name-only`) and ask the developer who should resolve the conflicts. When the developer asks you to resolve them, fix the conflicts, `git add` the files, and run `git rebase --continue`. In every other case (the developer resolves them, the conflicts cannot be resolved, or the rebase fails otherwise) run `git rebase --abort` and stop the run.

- **Skills current in `liferay-portal-ee`.** In `liferay-portal-ee` only, run `git fetch <remote> master`. When `git rev-parse master` differs from `git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD`, the copied skills are stale, so stop the run and tell the developer to copy them again from the latest `master`.

- **Diff baseline is local `${BASE_BRANCH}`.** After the rebase, the three dot diff against local `${BASE_BRANCH}` is the baseline.

- **Diff is nonempty.** When the three dot diff produces no files, exit with a one line message — no validation produces useful signal on a clean branch.

## Input

### Diff

```bash
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD "${BASE_BRANCH}")

git diff --name-only --no-renames "${MERGE_BASE}...HEAD"
```

Keep `--no-renames`. A detected rename collapses to its new path alone and hides the old one from every validation.

### Routing

The folder a validation file sits in decides its scope. A validation sees only the changed paths its scope covers.

- **Branch.** A file in `validations/branch` checks the branch as a whole and sees every changed path.

- **Portal.** A file in `validations/portal` sees every changed path that belongs to no workspace.

- **Workspaces.** A file in `validations/workspaces` runs once for each workspace the branch changed. A workspace is a directory named `workspaces/<name>-workspace`, and every path beneath it belongs to that workspace. The validation sees those paths relative to the workspace directory.

Paths directly under `workspaces` that sit in no workspace, such as the refresh scripts, belong to the portal scope.

In every workspace other than `liferay-sample-workspace`, a changed path that `workspaces/refresh_other_workspaces.sh` regenerates is seen only by [Generated Workspace File](validations/workspaces/generated-file.md). Such a path may change only through a refresh, and building it would only repeat what the sample workspace already checks. A path is regenerated when it does not match the regex that validation builds from the script's `--exclude` patterns. A workspace whose changed paths are all regenerated therefore runs no other workspace validation. Generated Workspace File in turn sees only regenerated paths, so it runs only for a workspace where the branch changed a regenerated path.

Run only the validations in the scopes the settings enable, and skip every validation the settings name. When the portal scope is disabled, list every changed path that belongs to no workspace in the Results Summary as unchecked, so that a change nothing examined never reads as a pass.

### Match

The script [find_modules.sh](find_modules.sh) beside this document takes paths relative to the repository root, from any directory inside it, finds the module of every changed path, and writes one line for it, `<module> <path>`, such as `modules/apps/blogs/blogs-api modules/apps/blogs/blogs-api/src/main/java/Foo.java`. Each validation in the branch and portal scopes fires on the paths whose line matches the regex under its `## Match`. ` &! ` splits a regex into an include side and an exclude side, and a line has to match the first and not the second.

- **Module** is the outermost directory above the path that the path's build root builds as a project. In a workspace, that is a directory holding `bnd.bnd` or `client-extension.yaml`, the rule the workspace Gradle plugin uses. The plugin also builds themes, wars, and JavaScript portlets, which no validation selects yet. Everywhere else, it is a directory holding `bnd.bnd`, `build.xml`, `gulpfile.js`, or `src/main/resources/application.properties`, not counting `modules` itself, the rule the Gradle settings plugin uses. It is `-` when there is none. A module under `modules` also has a Gradle project path, the directory without `modules/` and with `:` for `/`, such as `apps:blogs:blogs-api`.

The path starts after the first space, so a regex anchors to the start of a path with a space, as in ` modules/`, where it would anchor to the start of the module with `^`.

### Build Root

The build root of a changed path is its workspace directory when it belongs to a workspace, and `${REPO_ROOT}` otherwise. A validation that needs a place to search, such as a sweep for references, searches the build root of the path it is examining. Every workspace validation runs its commands from `${BUILD_ROOT}`, which is the absolute path of its workspace directory.

## Expected Output

**`PASS`** or **`FAIL`**, followed by a **Results Summary** table the `pr` and `pr-check-publish` skills reuse to record what was tested on the GitHub PR.

The procedure runs in two passes over the validations, in the order below. The order is dependency-driven: drift first (later validations see the regenerated tree), then formatting, then build, then tests.

Process each validation in a subagent.

### Pass 1: Estimate

Resolve the diff once, from `${REPO_ROOT}`, into a file of your own outside the repository:

```bash
git diff --name-only --no-renames "${MERGE_BASE}...HEAD" | bash <skill directory>/find_modules.sh "${MERGE_BASE}" > <resolved file>
```

Read the `## Match` regexes of the branch and portal validations the settings enable, and nothing else from those files yet:

```bash
command grep --after-context=2 '^## Match' <validation file>...
```

For each validation, write the lines its regex matches to a **work list** file of its own. Leave out the second `grep` when the regex has no ` &! `, and for a portal validation drop the lines of paths in a workspace with `command grep --invert-match ' workspaces/[^/]*-workspace/'` as well:

```bash
command grep --extended-regexp '<include side>' <resolved file> | command grep --extended-regexp --invert-match '<exclude side>' > <work list>
```

A validation fires when its work list is not empty. Read the files of the validations that fired, and only those.

For each validation that fired, write the three lists its **Command** reads, so that no **Command** parses a resolved line:

```bash
cut -d " " -f2- <work list> > <changed paths>
cut -d " " -f1 <work list> | command grep --invert-match '^-$' | sort --unique > <changed modules>
command grep '^modules/' <changed modules> | sed "s#^modules/##; s#/#:#g" > <changed projects>
```

The changed paths are the paths the validation selected, the changed modules are their modules, and the changed projects are the Gradle project paths of the changed modules under `modules`, such as `apps:blogs:blogs-api`.

A workspace validation fires once for each workspace the branch changed, as **Routing** describes. Read the files under `validations/workspaces` only when the branch changed a workspace.

Sum the time estimates of the validations that fired for the cumulative total, counting a workspace validation once for each workspace it fired for.

When the total exceeds 20 minutes, surface the breakdown and ask the developer whether to trim a validation or proceed.

### Pass 2: Execute

The rules below divide in two. Dispatch, ordering, the shared setup, handoffs, the ledger, and the overall state belong to this runner. Reading a log, judging a result, and reporting a note belong to the subagent, which never sees this document and is told only what it needs.

For each matched validation, spawn one subagent. **Give it only the `## Command` and `## Autocommit` sections of its validation.** Pass each section whole, from its heading to the next `## ` heading, and never through a line cap such as `head`, `tail`, or a fixed line range: a truncated section reads as complete, the subagent cannot know what it lost, and nothing downstream recovers it. A validation with no `## Autocommit` section makes no commit, so say so rather than leaving the subagent to infer it from an absence. That says nothing about the working tree, since a validation without one can still build and leave output behind. Record `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `NOT VERIFIED`, and capture any note the command directs it to return. Tell the subagent to run every command in the foreground and to return only once it has a verdict. A subagent that starts a build in the background and returns while it runs hands back no verdict, and nothing reports the build's result afterward. Do not halt on a failure, so the developer sees the full picture.

A validation reports **`NOT VERIFIED`** when it ran and established nothing about the branch, such as an empty work set, a compile with no source, or a change with no counterpart to exercise. It does not block, and it carries a reason naming what went unexamined, one line in the table with whatever detail the validation asks for beneath it. Reserve `FAIL` for a validation that found a real defect.

A `NOT VERIFIED` run does not autocommit, since a run that established nothing has produced nothing worth recording and the tree it would stage may hold a half finished setup. A `FAIL` run still autocommits where its **Autocommit** section says to, because a formatter's repairs are worth keeping even when an unfixable violation blocks the branch, and so does a `PASS` run. Tell the subagent this when you dispatch it, since its **Autocommit** section reads as unconditional on its own.

Run workspace validations one workspace at a time. Each workspace build has its own Gradle daemon and heap and shares the Gradle cache with the others. Never pass `--offline` to a workspace build, since a cache miss under it prints as a dependency error that reads exactly like a compile failure.

Run a validation that autocommits with **nothing else that writes to the working tree** in flight, since `git add --all` cannot tell its own repair from one another validation made seconds earlier and commits the wrong work under its title. A validation that only reads is safe alongside anything, provided it reads a commit it pinned at the start rather than the working tree or the index. A concurrent validation moves the tree when it writes and the index when it stages, so only a pinned commit holds still for the whole run. Whether a validation reads or writes can depend on the diff, since **Module Registration** only reports when its markers are all removals and builds when one is added, so treat it as a writer unless its own text rules the writing branch out for the diff at hand. Keep tree writers off each other too, since several share build output such as `modules/build/node`.

Run `ant compile install-portal-snapshots` once before the first validation that declares it, rather than letting each launch the same build into the same `${REPO_ROOT}/.m2`. Tell every later subagent that it is satisfied, since a subagent sees only its own **Command** and would otherwise run it again.

A validation may hand off to another, as **Per-Module Compile** does when its deploy set grows past the point where one full build is cheaper. Run the validation it names, give the table that validation's row and result, and mark the one that handed off `NOT VERIFIED`. Pass 1 selects on the changed paths alone and cannot see a set Pass 2 derives, so a handoff is the only way those branches run.

An autocommit can change the diff, so recompute the ledger after a validation whose commit may add a path Pass 1 never saw, as Baseline's `packageinfo` and `bnd.bnd` repairs do, and dispatch whatever newly fires. Skip it after a validation that can only touch paths the branch already changed, such as a formatter running in current branch mode, since its commit cannot widen the diff.

Tell Integration Test Compile and Per-Module Compile whether Full Portal Build is in the run, since each narrows its work when it is.

Give the subagent everything the validations use and none of them define. That is `${REPO_ROOT}`, `${BASE_BRANCH}`, `${SOURCE_SHA}`, `${BUILD_ROOT}` for a workspace validation, `${MERGE_BASE}`, `${CHANGED_PATHS}`, `${CHANGED_MODULES}`, and `${CHANGED_PROJECTS}` as the paths of its three lists, and `${SKILL_DIR}` as the directory holding this document for a branch or portal validation, the ticket their **Autocommit** sections write into a commit title as `<TICKET>`, and the result its own verdict implies for committing, since the rule above lives here and the subagent never reads this document:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

Resolve `<TICKET>` from the branch name the way [commit.md](../../rules/commit.md) does, which is the ticket pattern of uppercase letters, hyphen, and digits rather than the whole branch name, so `LRCI-8065-rules` and `LRCI-8065-fixture-pr1f` both give `LRCI-8065`. A subagent that is not given it commits under the literal string.

Tell it how to commit as well, since no validation says. The title is the whole message, with no body and no attribution footer of any kind, which is the repository's convention for a generated commit.

When the validation's **Command** is a build (gradle, ant, npm, jest), keep the whole log and bound only what is displayed:

```bash
LOG_CHECK=$(mktemp)
LOG_SETUP=$(mktemp)

<setup command> > "${LOG_SETUP}" 2>&1
<check command> > "${LOG_CHECK}" 2>&1

tail --lines=100 "${LOG_CHECK}"
```

Give each build its own log. A single binding reused across two builds means the second overwrites the first, and the evidence that setup succeeded is gone by the time you need it. A **Command** with one build needs only one.

Judge from each full log rather than from the tail. A source formatter prints its violations in the middle of a run and its stack trace at the end, so the last hundred lines carry the failure and not the reason for it. Search every log the run produced for the build tool's markers (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, `BUILD FAILED`, `Tests:`, `Test Suites:`) and for whatever the validation says its finding looks like. Apply this to build commands only, and leave inert commands like `git status --porcelain` untouched.

When a **Command** runs more than one build, keep a log per build and judge each on its own, since a setup step and the check it precedes fail for different reasons. The setup is the earlier build the later one depends on, and a validation that runs two checks rather than a setup and a check should say so.

A failing setup is positive evidence the run could not proceed, so report `NOT VERIFIED` naming it rather than a verdict on a check that never ran, and judge the check itself only once its setup succeeded. That is the case the rule below is about, even though its examples are all external.

A log can be far larger than you can read. Search it for the markers above rather than reading it through, and quote the lines you found. The displayed tail is for the developer, never the basis of a verdict.

Return the decisive lines verbatim with the verdict — the marker, count, or task line the validation names as its proof — rather than a description of them. A verdict that arrives without them is `NOT VERIFIED`: the runner can quote what it was given and cannot vouch for what it was not, and otherwise a subagent that skipped a command reads the same as one that ran it.

When a command ran and exited nonzero, that status alone does not separate a validation that found something from one that could not run. Report `NOT VERIFIED` there only on positive evidence that the run could not proceed, such as a failed download, a registry timeout, or a process killed for memory. Without that evidence report `FAIL`, since a subagent is given the Command and Autocommit sections alone and often cannot tell a finding from an infrastructure error by its wording, and defaulting to `FAIL` leaves a real defect blocking rather than passing it through as unverified.

That governs a nonzero exit and nothing else. A validation that names its own `NOT VERIFIED` case reports it whatever any command exited.

## Results Summary

After the two passes complete, emit a Results Summary block. It is the canonical record of what was tested, embedded verbatim by the `pr` skill into the PR description and reused by the `pr-check-publish` skill when recording a run on an existing PR.

Capture the tested commit with `git rev-parse HEAD` **after** Pass 2 completes, so the SHA reflects the tree that was actually exercised — including any autocommits the validations made, such as the `<TICKET> SF` source-format commit. This is the commit the `pr` skill pushes as the PR head and the commit the webhook binds the `pr-check` status to, so a reviewer can tell whether the current head is the one that was tested.

The block is the overall state and tested SHA, followed by a table with one row per **matched** validation — the validations that actually ran, in the execution order above. A workspace validation has one row for each workspace it ran for, named with the workspace in parentheses, such as `Workspace Compile (liferay-aihub-workspace)`. Validations that did not fire are omitted rather than listed as skipped, so the table reflects only what the diff exercised. When no validation fired, omit the table as well and say so in one line, since a header with no rows reads as a table that failed to render.

```markdown
**pr-check: PASS** — tested on `<head-SHA>`

| Validation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Source Format | PASS |
| Module Registration | NOT VERIFIED |
| Java Unit Tests | PASS |

Module Registration verified nothing. The diff removes `.lfrbuild-ci` from `apps:blogs:blogs-api`, which drops the module from CI's deploy pass and breaks no build, so whether CI still needs it is the developer's judgment.
```

The overall state is `FAIL` when any row is `FAIL`, and `PASS` otherwise. A `NOT VERIFIED` row leaves the overall state alone, and the marker the `pr-check-publish` skill writes still records `success`, since the webhook accepts only `failure`, `skipped`, and `success` and silently discards anything else.

A validation may qualify its verdict, as **Baseline** does when it names the universe it compared, and the qualifier follows the verdict in the same cell rather than in a note. The overall state reads the verdict alone, so a qualified `PASS` is still a `PASS`.

Every row whose validation returned a note appends it below the table, separated by a blank line. A `FAIL` and a `NOT VERIFIED` always carry one, and a `PASS` can too, as **Module Registration** does when a diff pairs an addition it verified with a removal it can only report. The notes travel verbatim into the PR description through the `pr` skill and into any comment the `pr-check-publish` skill posts.
